To run on your own machine:

1. Do the set up procedure at my frontend @https://github.com/osamahan999/wsbFrontend
2. remove all node modules if I have not done that yet. Then npm install
3. Set up a MySQL server, and put the server details in the .env file
4. Get a Tradier Developer api token and put four of those into the .env, numbered from token1, to token4. I randomly select one token from the four tokens
to try to quadruple my free calls.
5. Enjoy losing your fake cash!
